  languages.

## Why Penguinrage?
Penguinrage is a username I have held for a long period of time and I had a history in my past as being an
"over-zealous" Linux user. Furthermore I like penguins and Tux happens to be a penguin. I have used numerous flavours of
Linux both commercial and non-commercial variants. I understand systemd, cronjob and am very confident behind a command
line. I'm constantly learning new things in Linux and tend to be dwelling in Linux forums.
