## Intro
This is a personal site that acts as front page for my Git repository. The site offers a direct link to my repositories and my contact email address. The site
also includes:

* My PGP public key for encryption purposes
* Previous projects
* IT relevant posts

## About Ian
Some things about me:

* Graduated from University of Sydney with a bachelor of computer science.
* I like snowboarding, programming, machine learning, discrete math and cryptography.
* I have programmed with multiple programming paradyms such as functional, logic-based, imperative and object oriented
  languages.
* I have lived in Japan for about 4 years and taught English as full time assistant language teacher. Travelling in
  Japan and other parts of Asia was safe to say "AWESOME".
* I'm pursuing a career in IT development with a love for automating all things.

## Why Penguinrage?
Penguinrage is a username I have held for a long period of time and I had a history in my past as being an
"over-zealous" Linux user. Furthermore I like penguins and Tux happens to be a penguin. I have used numerous flavours of
Linux both commercial and non-commercial variants. I understand systemd, cronjob and am very confident behind a command
line. I'm constantly learning new things in Linux and tend to be dwelling in Linux forums.
