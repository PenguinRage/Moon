## About Gradeproof Project
The aim of the project was to access informative data about the services users are interacting with the Gradeproof
service. The Gradeproof project needed ways of quickly visualising key metrics in the data and querying metrics
programmatically for the client through an API and a web application dashboard. For 12 weeks, the project involved the team members
and I to build these products in order to meet the clients requirements. We utilized python and javascript, utilizing
it's frameworks and libraries to build the product.
